**Synopsis**

Git is the dominant tool for version management. Misunderstanding and misusing Git can cost
development teams time, energy, and money. Few better examples exist than Git's default merge
workflow which creates repositories that are hard to read, debug, and maintain. In this talk, I'll
show how to use the Rebase Workflow instead, which puts Git to work for you to produce quality code
that's easy to handle and kicks your team into high gear. We'll also get a chance to look at [Git
Lint](https://www.alchemists.io/projects/git-lint) which is a linter for your Git commits written in
Ruby!
