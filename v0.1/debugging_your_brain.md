Talk Title: Debugging Your Brain Workshop
Talk Synopsis (< 250 words):
The human brain is buggy. Sometimes your mind distorts reality, gets frustrated with shortcomings, and spirals out of control. With practice, you can debug your brain. Catch those distortions of reality, transform those frustrations into insight, and short-circuit those downward spirals.

In this workshop you will get a chance to practice each core idea from Caseyâ€™s book [Debugging Your Brain](https://www.debuggingyourbrain.com): Modeling The Brain, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Introspection, Identifying Inputs, Experience Processing, Experience Validation, and Cognitive Restructuring.

Debugging Your Brain is a clear applied psychology book and a concise self-help book, available in all three formats: printed book, eBook and audiobook: [debuggingyourbrain.com](https://www.debuggingyourbrain.com)
