Talk Title: Kaigi on Rails - creating a tech conference in the era of online
Talk Synopsis (< 250 words):
I'm the chief organizer of [Kaigi on Rails](https://kaigionrails.org), a new tech conference from Japan.
It launched last year and started its history as an online conference, apart from its original idea.
I'm planning to improve it to be a better online conference this year to empower more people,
from newbies to experienced devs.
Kaigi on Rails is currently a domestic conference, but will hopefully be an international from next year.
In this talk, I'm going to talk briefly about Kaigi on Rails and some ideas around it,
and propose the audience to be part of it.
