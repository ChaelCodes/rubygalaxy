* **Talk Title**: Kindness Matters: The Case for Ruby as a Superior Programming Language
* **Talk Synopsis (< 250 words)**:
Language is about communication and connection, and programming languages are more about communicating with other developers than they are about communicating with machines. People dismiss Ruby as a "great first language" but in this talk I will make the case for Ruby as the supreme programming language because it is the kindest programming language when it comes to human communication.

Writing unreadable code for the sake of brevity is a form of gate keeping. It is a feature of engineering culture that preserves homogeny and creates unnecessary barriers to entry for marginalized groups who may be newer to the field, and may think and communicate differently. Software engineering as a discipline has been dominated by white cis-gendered males as long as it has been a practice. As the field becomes more diverse, the languages will necessarily need to evolve to accommodate new perspectives and experiences. In a time such as this, Ruby is the premier language because it is  was designed with kindness in mind.
