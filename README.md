### Tracks
#### Building Inclusive Communities

What makes the Ruby community so special is the diversity and uniqueness of all of our contributors. As a community that shapes the future of technology, it is important to create an empowering, inclusive, and productive space where all members can come together to collaborate. Talks in this track should center around the various challenges and solutions to building a more inclusive, welcoming, and intentional space for developers, and how we can apply those learnings to the Ruby community. 

#### Ruby as a Start
 
Through innovative educational programs, there are more and more developers from nontraditional, non-STEM backgrounds. This track is meant for junior developers and bootcamp grads to share their experience with Ruby, advice on breaking into tech, and give advice to more senior engineers to help integrate developers from nontraditional backgrounds into their teams.

#### Weird Ruby

Ruby is a versatile language that has been used to implement the most whimsical of projects. We want to highlight the weirdest, wackiest, most obscure Ruby projects created by the community. Wow us with your out-of-this-world creativity, we can't wait. 

#### Looking Back

It wouldnt be software development if there weren't mistakes or stories to tell. This track are the stories of Ruby. We want to hear about your experience with mistakes and lessons learned.
